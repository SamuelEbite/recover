# recover

This is a C program that recovers JPEG images from a forensic image file. The program reads in a forensic image file, which is assumed to contain a number of JPEG images that have been deleted or lost. The program searches for the signature of a JPEG file in each block of the forensic image file and writes the blocks to a new file when it encounters the signature.

Usage

To use this program, compile it and provide the name of the forensic image file as an argument when running the program. The syntax for running the program is:

shell
Copy code
./recover [forensic image filename]
If the forensic image file is not provided or is not found, the program will output an error message and exit with a status code of 1. If there is an error creating an output file, the program will output an error message and exit with a status code of 3.

How it works

The program reads the forensic image file one block at a time, using a buffer of size 512 bytes. It searches for the signature of a JPEG file in each block. If the signature is found, it opens a new output file and writes the current block to the file. The program continues writing to the output file until the next signature is found. When a new signature is found, the program closes the current output file and opens a new one.

The signature for a JPEG file is a sequence of bytes that begins with 0xffd8 and ends with 0xff followed by a byte whose first four bits are 1110. The program checks for this signature by examining the first four bytes of each block.

Limitations

The program assumes that the forensic image file contains only JPEG images and that these images are stored in contiguous blocks. It does not check for the presence of other types of files, and it may not be able to recover images that are fragmented across multiple blocks or that have been partially overwritten.
